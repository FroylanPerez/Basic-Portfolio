    <p id="paragraph1">I was born on June 26, 1974 in Mexico City. I have two children that are my energy and inspiration. I studied accountant at ITESM-CCM. I never worked as an accountant, instead I started in 2003 my own business renting inflatable games. At first my website was a microsite provided by Seccion Amarilla, then I build it with Terra frameworks wich were very simple, in 2013 by Google advice I get a new website made in WordPress, this website work much better than all the previous ones but I wasn´t completly satisfied so I hired a web developer and I tried to transmit all my ideas but one more time this new website is not what I expected.</p>
    <p id="paragraph2">I love sports and music. I ran three times Mexico City Marathon and a lot of minor races; I love Futbol and Football, I am a Steeler Fan since I was born. I like old school Heavy Metal. I recently started riding motorcycle and I really love it. I love beeing financially independent (rather independant in every way) so that´s the main reason I get involved in BootCamp. I really want to make my own system and web application.</p>
