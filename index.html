    <img src="Assets/Images/froyOk.jpg" id="myPicture">
    <p id="paragraph1">I was born on June 26, 1974 in Mexico City. I studied accountant at ITESM-CCM from 1994 to 1998, then I never worked as an accountant, instead I started my own business renting inflatable games. After 17 years married I get divorced. I have two children that are my energy and inspiration.</p>
    <p id="paragraph2">I love sports and music. I ran three times Mexico City Marathon and a lot of minor races; I love Futbol and Football, I am a Steeler Fan since I was born. I like old school Heavy Metal. I recently started riding motorcycle and I really love it. I love beeing financially independent (rather independant in every way) so thatÂ´s the main reason I get involved in BootCamp. I really want to make my own system and web application.</p>
